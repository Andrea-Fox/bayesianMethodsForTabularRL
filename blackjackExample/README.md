## Blackjack example
This folder contains all the code to recreate the example described in section 2.7 .

The code to be executed to get the same results as in the thesis is `blackjackExample.py`. This file also creates the plots seen in Figure 2.1, as well as the Q-table for the corresponding number of episodes. 

`printTable.py` creates the same plots as the one seen in figurs 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.
