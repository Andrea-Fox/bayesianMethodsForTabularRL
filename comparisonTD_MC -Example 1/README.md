## Example 1: comparison between temporal difference methods and Monte Carlo methods

This folder contains the code for example 1, found in section 3.2.

The goal is to compute the probability of finishing the episode in the terminal state positioned on the right in the graph depicted in Figure 3.1.

The plots will contain different vaues of the RMSE (root mean squared error) for different values of the learning rate and of the number of episodes considered.
